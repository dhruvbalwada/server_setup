# Things to do after installations

- Install DEVONthink3 manually (this can probably be automated after the beta)

- Set up Google Backup and Sync (screenshots of settings in devonthink)

- Adobe stuff
	- Lightroom setup

- Carbon Copy Cloner?


set up ssh keys - I might be able to automatize this aswell (Manual, at this point)

## more notes
Apps to reinstall:

- DEVONthink 3
	- Special setup?
- HP Printer Software (which one is the proper one?
- LRTimeLapse...(How?)
- Microsoft Office? Probably don't need it
- ROLAND interface driver
- LATEX?
