# Things to do after installations

- Install DEVONthink3 manually (this can probably be automated after the beta)

- Set up Google Backup and Sync (screenshots of settings in devonthink)

- Adobe stuff
	- Lightroom setup

- Carbon Copy Cloner?


set up ssh keys - I might be able to automatize this aswell (Manual, at this point)
